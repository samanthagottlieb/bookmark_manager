# Bookmark Manager
Makers Academy Week 4 Challenge

## The project
A bookmark manager used to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). The bookmark manager can be used to:
- save webpages you found useful
- add tags to the saved webpages to find them later
- browse bookmarks other users have added
- comment on the bookmarks

## User stories
```
As a user
So that I can see the websites I have bookmarked
I would like to see a list of bookmarks
